Calculate rewardpoints for 3 months

Interview coding ASSIGNMENT--for these roles, make it a JS based solution

A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.

A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent over $50 in each transaction

(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).

Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.

SOLUTION :
Gave one record per month for four months
Transaction1  220$
Transaction2  70$
Transaction3  140$
Transaction4  9$

(120$ = 2*120+ 1*50 =>290
 70$ = 1*20=>20
140$= 2*40+1*50=>130
9$ => 0)
